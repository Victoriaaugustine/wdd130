  <h2>My Tribe & Origin</h2>
  <h2>Akwa Ibom State, Niger Delta, Nigeria</h2>

  <p>
    I proudly hail from <strong>Midim Atan, Ekpeyung Atai, in the Ekpeyung Clan of Essien Udim Local Government Area, Akwa Ibom State</strong>, 
    located in the South-South region of the <strong>Niger Delta, Nigeria</strong>.  
    My people belong to the great <strong>Ibibio tribe</strong>, one of the oldest, largest, and most respected ethnic groups in Akwa Ibom.  
  </p>

  <p>
    The Ibibio are known for their <strong>rich cultural heritage and traditions</strong>, showcased through colorful festivals, 
    vibrant music, and energetic dances like <em>Ekpo</em>, <em>Ekpe</em>, and <em>Abang</em>.  
    We are also celebrated for our delicious dishes such as <em>afang soup</em>, <em>edikang ikong</em>, 
    <em>ekpang nkukwo</em>, and <em>afia efere</em>.  
  </p>

  <p>
    As a people, we value <strong>family, unity, hospitality, education, and spirituality</strong>.  
    Our homeland is blessed with abundant <strong>mineral resources</strong>, fertile farmlands, rivers, and forests, 
    making us one of the most naturally endowed groups in Nigeria. The Niger Delta is especially famous for being rich in 
    <strong>oil, natural gas, limestone, and clay</strong>.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond natural wealth, the Ibibio are admired for their <strong>wisdom, resilience, craftsmanship, farming, and entrepreneurship</strong>.  
    We take pride in our <strong>traditional governance systems</strong>, our strong sense of <strong>identity</strong>, 
    and our contributions to the growth and development of Nigeria as a whole.
